### WHY IMPORTANT
* Deep Learning is important for one reason, and one reason only: weâ€™ve finally been able to achieve meaningful, useful accuracy on tasks that matter.
	+ Computer vision - is a great example of a task that Deep Learning has transformed into something realistic for business application. Facebook has had major success with identifying faces in photographs.
	+ Speech recognition - is another area that has felt Deep Learningâ€™s impact.
