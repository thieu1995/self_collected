## You shouldn't be a DATA SCIENCE GENERALIST!!!

* DATA SCIENCE isn’t a single, well-defined field, and companies don’t hire generic “data scientists”, but rather individuals with very specialized skill sets.

* And it’s hard to avoid becoming a generalist. That’s why Jeremie Harris put together a list of five problem classes that are often lumped under the “data science” heading:

```code
1. DATA ENGINEER: managing data pipelines for companies that deal with large volumes of data.
2. DATA ANALYST: translating data into actionable business insights.
3. DATA SCIENTIST: cleaning and exploring datasets, as well as making predictions that deliver business value.
4. MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEER: building, optimizing and deploying machine learning models to production.
5. MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCHER: finding new ways to solve challenging problems in both data science and deep learning.
```
